/**
 * Previously the dashboard cache was pure TTL (up to 60s stale after any mutation) with nothing
 * ever calling evict on it, despite AGENTS.md §22 explicitly asking for eviction on
 * product/inventory/order/warehouse changes. Injected into those services and called after a
 * successful mutation. See KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md "Addressed in this pass".
 * <p>
 * A separate component (rather than a method on {@link DashboardService} itself) so that
 * product/warehouse/inventory/order services don't need to depend on DashboardService — this is
 * the only thing about the dashboard they need to know about.
 * <p>
 * Uses {@link CacheManager} directly (not a declarative {@code @CacheEvict}) so the actual evict
 * can be deferred to after the caller's transaction commits via {@link TransactionUtils} — the
 * same fix applied to {@code RolePermissionService.evict}: evicting mid-transaction leaves a
 * window where a concurrent read can repopulate the cache with the pre-change value.
